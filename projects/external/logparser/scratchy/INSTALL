In order to use this version of Scratchy there are several installation dependencies.

Deprecated from pre-0.8 versions:
================================
   - GDChart (which has been replaced in favor of ChartDirector)
   - Many complex internal data structures have been replaced with a SQL database
   - Country Lookups via http (replaced with a GeoIP database)

Prequisites:
============

   - MySQL - www.mysql.com (v4.0 or later recommended)
   - MySQLdb - http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python

  (future versions of Scratchy may support pySQLlite and/or Gadfly 
   in addition to MySQL.  Preliminary support is included but it should
   be considered very experimental until officially supported)

Optional (and recommended):
==========================
 
   - ChartDirector v3.0 Python API - www.advsofteng.com/
   - GeoIP C API - http://www.maxmind.com/app/opensource
   - GeoIP Python API - http://www.maxmind.com/app/opensource

Installation:
============

1. Obtain, install and configure MySQL as necessary.  You will need a server
   and a client.  Ensure that you have a user setup that can create and drop
   a database, among other privs.  This is necessary for the scripts included 
   with Scratchy to be able to create a database and tables for data storage.
   
2. Obtain and install the Python MySQLdb package.

3. If desired, obtain and install the ChartDirector Python package.
   If you would like to have the Scratchy report process to create
   charts of the Apache log data then you need this package (ealier
   versions of Scratchy used gdchart but I have abandoned that in
   favor of the easier to use/install ChartDirector product).
   
   a) ChartDirector's trial version included a yellow banner at
      the bottom of each chart.  The fine folks at Advanced Software Engineering
      have created a replace library for the Scratchy project which 
      replaces this yellow banner with a less obtrusive, transparent 
      banner that is specific to the Scratchy project.  You can
      download the Linux/Windows replacement library (.so or DLL)
      from the Scratchy project page on Sourceforge.

4. If desired, install the C and Python GeoIP API's.
   If you would like "ip to country" data included in your reports you
   need these packages.  Earlier versions of Scratchy relied on an
   http service which is no longer active.  The MaxMind GeoIP product
   is much faster (since the data is stored locally in a DAT file) then
   accessing this information over a network.
   a) You may wish to obtain the latest .DAT file from MaxMind as well 
      (this file has the latest ip address to country data)

5. Create a Scratchy configuration file.  See Scratchy website for details.

6. Run Scratchy:

parse.py -c your_config_file apache_access_log1 apache_access_log2 ... apache_access_logN
